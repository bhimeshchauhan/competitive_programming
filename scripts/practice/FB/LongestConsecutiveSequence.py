Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

"""

# Brute force solution

"""

Iterate through each number from nums and keep 
counting untill you dont have the number in nums

Time Complexity: O(n^3)
Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):

            current_streak = 1

                current_streak += 1

            longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)

        return longest_streak

# Sorting


"""

sort the nums and check for increasing 
pattern and keep incrementing the count.

Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n).
