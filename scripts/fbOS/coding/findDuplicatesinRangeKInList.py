Find duplicates within a range k in an array

Given an array and a positive number k, check whether the array contains any duplicate elements within the range k. If k is more than the arrayâ€™s size, the solution should check for duplicates in the complete array.

For example,

Input:

nums[] = { 5, 6, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9 }
k = 4

Output: Duplicates found

(element 6 repeats at distance 4 which is <= k)

Input:

nums[] = { 5, 6, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9 }
k = 2

Output: No duplicates were found

(element 6 repeats at distance 4 which is > k) 

Input:

nums[] = { 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 }
k = 7

Output: Duplicates found

(element 1 and 2 repeats at distance 4 and 2, respectively which are both <= k)
Practice this problem

A naive solution would be to consider every subarray of size k and check for duplicates in it. The time complexity of this solution is O(n.k2) since there can be n subarrays of size k, and each subarray might take O(k2) time for checking duplicates.

The problem can be efficiently solved using hashing in O(n) time and O(n) extra space. The idea is to traverse the array and store each element and its index in a map, i.e., (element, index) as (key, value) pairs in a map. If any element is already found present on the map, check if that element repeats within the range of k using its previous occurrence information from the map.

                return True

    # we reach here when no element repeats within range `k`
