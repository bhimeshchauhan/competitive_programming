Word Search

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example 1:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

m == board.length
n = board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 6
1 <= word.length <= 15
board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

"""
If the length of the "word" is greater than the size of the "board" (#rows * #cols) we can simply return False. Also, we can check if each character in "word" exists in "board", if there is at least one character that does not exist in "board" we can simply return False. Performing these two prunings we can return False immediately instead of computing further.
